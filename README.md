# Code_Generation_Assistant


## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to design optimized prompts to generate clean, well-documented, and efficient Python and JavaScript code using an AI assistant.

## Problem Statement

The task is to create prompts that guide the AI in generating functional, readable, and efficient code for various use cases.

## Solution Approach

* Clear and structured prompt design.
* Specification of programming languages (Python, JavaScript).
* Emphasis on clean, well-commented code.
* Handling of edge cases and errors.
* Regular refinement of prompts.

## Example Prompts

### Python Code Generation

**Prompt:**
"Generate a clean, well-documented Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of their squares. The function should handle empty lists and invalid inputs gracefully."

### JavaScript Code Generation

**Prompt:**
"Generate a JavaScript function that calculates the factorial of a number. Ensure the code is efficient and includes clear comments."

## Project Structure

* `prompts.txt`: Contains all the optimized prompts designed for this project.
* `example_code/`: A folder containing Python and JavaScript code generated using the optimized prompts.
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Prompt-Engineering-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to this project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Project3_Code_Generation_Assistant
   ```
3. Explore the prompt designs in `prompts.txt` and test them with your AI assistant.

## Future Improvements

* Add support for other programming languages.
* Optimize prompts for even cleaner and faster code.
